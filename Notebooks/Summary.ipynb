    "Write a summary statement that highlights the key processes and findings from this notebook. This should include information such as the original number of rows in the data, whether our own resort was actually present etc. What columns, if any, have been removed? Any rows? Summarise the reasons why. Were any other issues found? What remedial actions did you take? State where you are in the project. Can you confirm what the target feature is for your desire to predict ticket price? How many rows were left in the data? Hint: this is a great opportunity to reread your notebook, check all cells have been executed in order and from a \"blank slate\" (restarting the kernel will do this), and that your workflow makes sense and follows a logical pattern. As you do this you can pull out salient information for inclusion in this summary. Thus, this section will provide an important overview of \"what\" and \"why\" without having to dive into the \"how\" or any unproductive or inconclusive steps along the way."

What aspects of the data (e.g. relationships between features) should you remain wary of when you come to perform feature selection for modeling?
